Description
===========

This is a library to access the Xiaomi Mi Band. It is written in C++,
along with some bindings for Python.

Compiling
=========

First, assure that you have the needed depends. The file called
DEPENDS shows what you need. If you use Debian or derivatives (like
Ubuntu), and want to install everyting in one step, just do the
following:

    miband$ sudo apt-get install $(cat DEPENDS)

After that, you can compile it with:

    miband$ make

Using it
========

First, make sure that your Python binary could find the miband
package. If you installed the Debian package, don't worry. Otherwise,
set the PYTHONPATH to the proper location (i.e: this repo root
dir). You can do so by:

    miband$ . setenv.sh

Now, just import the module `mibanda`, and use it according to the API
documentation, or as in the examples.
