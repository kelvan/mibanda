Description
===========

This is a pure Python library to access the Xiaomi Mi Band. It uses
the library called pygattlib underneath.

Using it
========

First, make sure that your Python binary could find the miband
package. If you installed the Debian package, don't worry. Otherwise,
set the PYTHONPATH to the proper location (i.e: this repo root
dir). You can do so by:

    miband$ . setenv.sh

Now, just import the module `mibanda`, and use it according to the API
documentation, or as in the examples.
